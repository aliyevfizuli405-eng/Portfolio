        <h1>How I Used Flexbox to Create a Responsive Portfolio Layout?</h1>
        <h3>When I started designing my portfolio, one of the biggest challenges was making sure it looked good on both desktop and mobile devices. I wanted a layout that was clean, modern, and easy to adapt. That's when I turned to CSS Flexbox.Flexbox is a powerful CSS module that makes it simple to align and distribute space among items in a container. Instead of writing complicated float rules or relying on external frameworks, I used Flexbox to handle responsiveness.</h3>

                <h2>Practical Example</h2>
                <p>In my portfolio, I used Flexbox for the navigation bar, hero section, and various card layouts. This approach not only made the code simpler but also ensured consistent alignment and spacing across all components.</p>
                <p>The responsive behavior came naturally with Flexbox. When the screen size decreased, I could simply change the flex-direction from row to column, and the layout adapted perfectly without additional complexity.</p>
