        <h1>How I Used Flexbox to Create a Responsive Portfolio Layout?</h1>
    <h3>When I started designing my portfolio, one of the biggest challenges was making sure it looked good on both desktop and mobile devices. I wanted a layout that was clean, modern, and easy to adapt. That's when I turned to CSS Flexbox.Flexbox is a powerful CSS module that makes it simple to align and distribute space among items in a container. Instead of writing complicated float rules or relying on external frameworks, I used Flexbox to handle responsiveness.</h3>
