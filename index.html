          <h3>Who I Am</h3>
          <p>I'm Fizuli Aliyev, an Information Security student at ASOIU with a passion for programming and creative problem-solving. Born in 2007, I've developed a strong interest in cybersecurity, web development, and emerging technologies.</p>
          
          <h3>My Journey</h3>
          <p>My programming journey started with a curiosity about how things work. Over time, I've built projects that combine my technical skills with creative thinking. I'm particularly interested in web development, security practices, and building user-friendly applications.</p>
          
          <h3>What Drives Me</h3>
          <p>I'm driven by the challenge of solving complex problems through code. I believe that good design and functionality go hand-in-hand. Whether it's building a responsive website or exploring security vulnerabilities, I approach every project with enthusiasm and attention to detail.</p>
          
          <h3>Beyond Code</h3>
          <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy learning about new technologies with github i search about useful tools for optimization and better gaming results and contributing to open-source projects, and sharing knowledge with other developers. I'm always looking for opportunities to collaborate and grow my skills.</p>
